<h1>Cyber Secuirty Analyst Lab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Built and deployed a virtualized home lab using VMware to simulate an enterprise environment. Installed and
configured a SIEM platform with WAZUH to collect and analyze security logs. Integrated Ubuntu and Windows virtual machines as log sources. Configured agents, log forwarding, and alert rules for security event detection.
Monitored authentication events, system changes, and potential security incidents. Gained hands-on experience with
log analysis, alerting, and incident visibility. Created custom alert rules, and tuned alert thresholds to reduce false
positives. Simulated security events to validate SIEM alerts.
